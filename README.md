# Sanity Photon

This is a simple starter for a headless shopify, sanity and a next.js e-commerce website.

It's ideal for small shops that want a truly custom experience for their storefront.

- The Next.js pages are statically generated for the sake of simplicity, speed and cost. You can create as many editorial pages as you want, and customize parts of your collection and product pages.
- Styling is intentionally kept very minimal for better control. You can bring in Tailwind, or use what I prefer, CSS modules.
- Sanity brings in a page builder with visual editing of your content. Sanity also helps manage SEO and OG previews.
- Shopify powers the commerce experience with SKU, payment, shipping and more.
- Kyslely is wired up for a simple email list keeping.

With the Sanity live API and the Shopify-Sanity sync, all data is cached and fine-grained revalidation is set up automatically for you. No webhooks needed.
