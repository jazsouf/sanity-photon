## Configuration üîß

### Sanity Configuration

1. Create a new Sanity project at [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage)
2. Get your Project ID from the project dashboard
3. Create an API token with read permissions
4. Add these to the respective `.env` files:

```
# studio/.env
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET="production"

# storefront/.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION="2024-01-01" # Use current or future date
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN="your-read-token"
```

### Shopify Configuration

1. Set up a Shopify store (or use an existing one)
2. Create a custom app in your Shopify Admin (Apps > Develop apps > Create an app)
3. Set up the Storefront API permissions
4. Generate a Storefront API token
5. Add Shopify variables to `storefront/.env`:

```
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token"
SHOPIFY_STORE_ID="your-store-id"
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN="your-store-id.myshopify.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN="your-store-id.myshopify.com"
```

### Klaviyo Configuration (Optional)

If you want to use Klaviyo for email list management:

1. Create a Klaviyo account and get your Public API Key
2. Add to `storefront/.env`:

```
KLAVIYO_PRIVATE_API_KEY="your-klaviyo-api-key"
```

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Project Structure

- `/studio` - Sanity Studio configuration and schemas
- `/storefront` - Next.js frontend application
  - `/app` - Routes and application components
  - `/components` - Reusable UI components
  - `/sanity` - Sanity client and queries
  - `/shopify` - Shopify integration logic

### Data Flow

1. **Products & Collections**: Managed in Shopify, synced to Sanity
2. **Content**: Managed in Sanity Studio
3. **Cart & Checkout**: Handled by Shopify Storefront API
4. **Front-end**: Next.js consumes data from Sanity's API, which includes the synced Shopify data

## Customization üé®

### Styling

The project uses CSS Modules for styling. You can:

- Continue using the CSS Modules approach
- Integrate Tailwind CSS
- Add any other styling solution you prefer

### Content Structure

Modify the Sanity schema in `/studio/src/schemas` to adapt the content model to your needs.

### Components

Customize UI components in `/storefront/components` to match your brand's design.

## Deployment üöÄ

### Sanity Studio

Deploy Sanity Studio to Sanity's hosting with:

```
cd studio
npx sanity deploy
```

### Next.js Storefront

The storefront can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any other Next.js-compatible hosting:

```
# For Vercel
